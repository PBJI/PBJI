# Introduction
Hi there! I'm Purshotam Bohra, and I'm a software developer with a passion for creating bash automation scripts. I'm also interested in web development, exploring AI and ML topics, and data analytics. In addition, I have a keen interest in software management techniques to improve software-based projects.

I enjoy building scripts and web applications using a variety of tools and languages, and I love exploring the latest technologies and frameworks. When it comes to automation, I'm always looking for ways to streamline workflows and simplify repetitive tasks using bash scripts.

In my free time, I like to read about AI and ML advancements and experiment with new data analysis techniques. I believe that technology has the power to transform our world, and I'm excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.

Please feel free to browse through my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on a project or discuss any interesting ideas.

# Projects
Edabit scraper (Javascript) and File processes automation script:

    This project involved creating a Javascript script that could scrape, extract and download problem statements from *edabit.com* into individual files.
    The extraction would include the problem, example output, notes, and resources in a structured text that is enclosed in a multiline comment at the start of a file.
    The file extension depended on the type of programming language the problem statement was meant for.
    The second part of the project was a bash script that streamlined processes like batch editing, renaming, structuring, testing, or executing the problem statement files.
    This project demonstrates the ability to automate repetitive tasks and create efficient workflows.

Ultimate TicTacToe javascript game:

    This project was created when you were learning Javascript in 2021 and is your first Javascript project.
    The game involves a 9x9 grid with 3x3 sub-grids, and the game logic is a variation of simple TicTacToe.
    A bot is implemented, although it is not optimized and therefore not intelligent.
    This project showcases my ability to apply programming concepts to create a functioning game.

WixCast:

    This project was designed to automate the uploading process of product details from WhatsApp to wix.com with the help of third-party APIs like imgur.com, openAI.com, and wix.com.
    However, the project was abandoned due to the monetary nature of some of the APIs and mistakes in evaluating the risks involved in actual implementation.
    Despite this, the project was a valuable learning experience in project management and how to modularize apps to practice clean code.
    This project demonstrates my ability to design a project and learn from mistakes.

Real Time Chat App:

    This project is a journey for me to explore the powerful frameworks of web technology to deal with abstract problems like engineering an SPA app.
    It is project that will help me know myself as a software engineer.
    The project aims towards a fully flegded chat app that utilizes MERN stack and other powerful frameworks. And focus is more on engineering then designing. So, it is expected to see broken css but functionality will not be compromised.
