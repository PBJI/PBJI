## Projects

### Real-Time Chat App (React Application) (Work in Progress)
I'm currently working on a real-time chat application using the MERN stack. While the project is still a work in progress, it represents my ongoing journey in web application development. The backend components, including MongoDB and Express, are yet to be fully implemented from scratch, and the UI functionality is still evolving with major features pending development.

### Profile Editor (React Application) (September 2023)

This React application, developed using TypeScript and styled components, serves as a simple profile editor. Users can manage profiles by editing attributes such as age, gender, name, country, and description. The application includes validation checks to ensure data integrity during the saving process.

### CodePens

#### Draggable Labelled Boxes
So, while dabbling with blessed library on npm, I realized I should create a similar kind of box that has a label on its top border. While creating this cute box I added an extra dose of dragginess (don't confuse with drowsiness) to it.
