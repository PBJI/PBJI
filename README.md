# Projects

### Real-Time Chat App (July 2023):
This project represents a personal odyssey, a journey into the dynamic realm of web technology where I grapple with abstract challenges such as engineering a Single Page Application (SPA). It serves as a means to gain profound insights into my role as a software engineer.

The primary objective of this endeavor is the creation of a comprehensive chat application. It harnesses the power of the MERN stack alongside other robust frameworks. While the project prioritizes engineering prowess over intricate design, it's worth noting that you may encounter occasional stylistic imperfections in the CSS. Nevertheless, rest assured that functionality remains uncompromised.

### WixCast (April 2023):
WixCast was conceived to automate the process of uploading product details from WhatsApp to wix.com, utilizing third-party APIs such as imgur.com, openAI.com, and wix.com. However, the project was halted due to the financial implications of some APIs and misjudgments in assessing the risks associated with actual implementation. Despite these challenges, this project served as a valuable learning experience in project management and the art of modularizing applications to foster clean code practices. It highlights my capacity to conceptualize projects and glean valuable insights from mistakes.

### Edabit Scraper and File Automation (December 2022):
This multifaceted project involved the creation of a JavaScript script capable of scraping, extracting, and downloading problem statements from *edabit.com* into individual files. The extracted content encompassed the problem description, example output, notes, and resources, all neatly organized within a multiline comment at the start of each file. The file extension was tailored to suit the specific programming language associated with the problem statement. The second facet of the project featured a bash script designed to streamline processes such as batch editing, renaming, structuring, testing, and executing the problem statement files. This project showcases my proficiency in automating repetitive tasks and devising efficient workflows.

### Ultimate TicTacToe JavaScript Game (November 2021):
This project dates back to my early days of learning JavaScript in 2021 when I was an absolute novice. It marks my maiden voyage into the world of JavaScript development. The game entails a 9x9 grid with 3x3 sub-grids, and its gameplay is a variation of traditional TicTacToe. Although a bot is implemented, it's important to note that it's not optimized and thus lacks advanced intelligence. This project serves as a testament to my ability to apply fundamental programming concepts in creating a functional game.
